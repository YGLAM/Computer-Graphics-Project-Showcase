# Showcase
_Computer Graphics 2021 exam project at Politecnico di Milano._

## Specifications
Imagine a shop window in which there are several objects on pedestals. You will have to present several pedestals with objects showing off different rendering techniques. It must be possible to select (with the keyboard) one of the pedestals to inspect it more closely. Optional (improved evaluation): use raycast to select the pedestal to inspect.

## Description
### Implementation
We were tasked to work with camera space coordinates, we also implemented both keyboard and mouse controls through a raycast algorithm
### Assets
_Boat_, _World_ and _Xwing_ were given by the professor, all the other assets were downloaded and had their UV maps edited with blender if needed:
- [Room](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/viking-room-a49f1b8e4f5c4ecf9e1fe7d81915ad38) model by nigelgoh, the pedestal model was reused from the scene
