# Showcase
_Computer Graphics 2021 exam project at Politecnico di Milano._

## Specifications
Imagine a shop window in which there are several objects on pedestals. You will have to present several pedestals with objects showing off different rendering techniques. It must be possible to select (with the keyboard) one of the pedestals to inspect it more closely. Optional (improved evaluation): use raycast to select the pedestal to inspect.
